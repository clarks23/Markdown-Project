# Movies

> In the past year, I've really gotten into movies. I like a lot of different aspects of filmmaking and hope to maybe be in the industry someday. I've yet to see a lot of classic and popular movies, but my list is always growing. As of now, here are my top 6 favorite movies:

1. No Country for Old Men
2. Oppenheimer
3. Oldboy
4. Heat
5. Whiplash
6. Django Unchained
